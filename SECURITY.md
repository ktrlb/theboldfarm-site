# Admin Panel Security

## üîê **Security Features**

The admin panel for The Bold Farm website includes several security measures to protect your farm's content management system.

- **Secure Logout**: Proper logout functionality clears authentication

### **Brute Force Protection**
- **Rate Limiting**: Maximum 5 failed login attempts
- **Account Lockout**: 15-minute lockout after failed attempts
- **Attempt Counter**: Shows remaining attempts to user

### **Current Password**
The default admin password is: `TheBoldFarm2024!`

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Change this password immediately after first login!**

### **How to Change Password**

2. Find the line: `const ADMIN_PASSWORD = "TheBoldFarm2024!";`
